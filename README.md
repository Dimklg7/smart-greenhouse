Developed a small-scale smart greenhouse using modern technologies for automated monitoring and management of environmental conditions
small-scale smart greenhouse that utilizes modern technologies for automated monitoring and management of critical environmental parameters. The system aims to optimize plant growth and create an efficient and sustainable cultivation system. The smart greenhouse incorporates various sensors and control devices, including temperature, air and soil humidity sensors, as well as control systems for lighting, irrigation, and ventilation. The heart of the system is a Raspberry Pi, which collects data from sensors and controls devices through GPIO pins. The project leverages the MQTT protocol for efficient communication between devices, allowing remote monitoring and control of the greenhouse. Additionally, it incorporates image processing and artificial intelligence technologies for plant health recognition and evaluation through photographs. The user interface, developed with the NiceGUI library, provides a user-friendly platform for monitoring greenhouse conditions and controlling devices. System tests showed high accuracy in sensor measurements and effective operation of control devices. In conclusion, the developed smart greenhouse offers a comprehensive solution for automated crop management, contributing to more efficient resource use and improved productivity in agriculture. Future improvements could include the integration of more sensors, upgrading the user interface, and further automation of control processes.
